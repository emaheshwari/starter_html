            <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste
                buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it. Note, these cookies are best eaten
                very quickly.</p>

            <p>7. This recipe is a fantastic way to step up your pasta game without taking too much more of your time. It tastes way
            better than basic pasta with jarred sauce! I originally found this when my sister made it, and got the recipe off of Bon
            Appetit’s website. PS avoid using the shaker parmesan – I used that the first time I made this and it drew down the
            quality of the dish.</p>

                <li>smush down with large spoon to release some leftover juices</li>
                <li>add in vinegar, olive oil, crushed red pepper and half of parmesan</li>
                <li>let marinate for half an hour</li>
